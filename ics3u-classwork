 Solving real life problems from the machine’s perspective.

Problem 1: The cookie is too big for the glass 
  1. How do you fix this problem?
    - Using disintegrator to smash the cookie in to small pieces. 
    - Grab the cookie's pieces. 
    - Reach to the glass.
    - Put the pieces into the glass slowly/softly.
    - Return to original position. 
  2. How can you prevent this problem?
    - Grab smaller cookies/Smash it into smaller pieces first.
  3. How can this problem be solved with an app?
    - Using the app to control the machine
    - Control the machine to move to the glass's position
    - Smash the cookie in to small pieces. 
    - Grab the cookie's pieces. 
    - Reach to the glass.
    - Put the pieces into the glass slowly/softly.
    
Problem 2: The spoon dropped into the gravy
  1. How do you fix this problem?
    - Moving Robotic arm forward until reach the spoon's position. 
    - Pick up the spoon slowly without splitting any soup/liquid.
    - Put the spoon on the edge of the gravy. 
    - Wait for 3 seconds until the spoon is stable, moving back to the original position.
  2. How can you prevent this problem?
    - Design an small alarm bell, the alarm will ring when the spoon is going to fall, which warns people to pay attention on the falling spoon. 
  3. How can this problem be solved with a robotic system?
    - Moving forward until reach the spoon's position. 
    - Pick up the spoon slowly without splitting any soup/liquid. 
    - Put one side of the spoon on the edge of the gravy slowly. 
    - Wait for 3 seconds until the spoon is stable, moving back to the original position. 
    
Problem 3: People who can’t park
  1. How do you fix this problem?
    - Erase the original parking lot. 
    - Using digital parking space, which sizes can change according to the size of the veicles. 
  2. How can you prevent this problem?
    - Using visual, digital parking space, which sizes can change according to the size of the veicles.
    - If there's a big truck going to park here, make a projection to the ground that imitate there's a parking space. 
  3. How can this problem be solved with a robotic and/or software solution?
    - Using Python to programming the process above. 
People hogging seats with bags
  1. How do you fix this problem?
    - Put the bags on the top of the bus/train uniformly. 
  2. How can you prevent this problem?
    - Design a place to storage those bagsUsing Moving machine to put the bags up to that place(the top of the bus). 
  3. How can this problem be solved with a technological solution?
    - Create a metal arm around the seat that doesn't bother passengers to rest comfortablely. 
    - Remove the big and heavy bags to the top of the bus slowly. 
    - Return to the original position carefully(without hurting the passengers)
